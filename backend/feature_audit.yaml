# 1. Health Monitor Backend (MISSING)
# -----------------------------------
# Backend:
# - Create `HealthVitals` model (user_id, type, value, unit, recorded_at)
# - Create `routers/health.py` with GET/POST endpoints
# - Create `schemas/health_schemas.py`
# - Update `main.py` to include health router
#
# Frontend:
# - Create `HealthService` to talk to backend
# - Update `HealthMonitorScreen` to fetch/post data instead of using random
# - Update `MyHealthScreen` to show aggregated stats from backend

# 2. Call Protection (EXISTS BUT UNVERIFIED)
# ------------------------------------------
# Backend:
# - `routers/call_protection.py` exists
# - Need to verify if tables `phone_reputation`, `user_reports` exist in DB
#
# Frontend:
# - Need to check if `CallService` connects to these endpoints
# - UI seems to be missing or I haven't seen it active

# 3. Settings (LOCAL ONLY)
# ------------------------
# - User wants "proper backend".
# - Should sync settings to DB? Or is local sufficient?
# - For now, focus on Health + Call as they are "core features".
